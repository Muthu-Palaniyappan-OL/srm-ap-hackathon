PayD- Offline Payment App

The offline payment processing system utilizes WiFi-Direct technology to transfer funds between devices.
Transactions are purely peer-to-peer, so there is no need for each transaction to connect with the server.
Once the transfer is complete, the device stores the information locally.
The system updates the central authority or server when the device goes back online.
This payment system is beneficial in places where internet connectivity is unreliable and there is a need to send funds quickly.
